            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is practically defined in its name; it is a system that helps a user control, or manage, different versions of a document, file, code, or any collection of information in general. The version control system is very useful for web designers and developers because it helps that keep track of the revisions of a certain code. This type of system does not overwrite preexisting information; everything is stored and time stamped, so you can know when the different revisions were made. The most popular version control system, and the one that we are currently using in this course is GitHub.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub (GIT) is an online version control system. This Web-based system serves as a remote repository that you can push small to very large projects to; for example, from your cloud 9 workspace. It saves your works and never overwrites them.  GitHub also has a social networking-like feature where users can create profiles and explore other peoples’ profile to see their code and/or projects; of course you have the ability to make your work private, or for public display on this online community. Therefore, it can also serve as an online portfolio showcasing all your skills. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user. The local repository stores data for a set of files; in this case our local repository is on the Cloud 9 workspace. You have the ability to pull files, or collection of information, from your remote repository to your local repository. On the other hand, a remote repository is a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members. For example, GitHub is one. You can push files from you local repository to your remote repository. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Push</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub has a few basic commands that allow users to interact with repositories. One basic command is Git push. This command is used to update remote refs along with associated objects. In other words, it is used to interact with the remote repository. If you want to send, or push files from the local repository to the remote repository that have already been “commit”, or saved then you must use the Git push command. Also you have the ability to specify the destination of Git push; the command takes to arguments, which are a remote name and a branch name</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Another basic command that GitHub has to allow users to interact with repositories is Git pull. This command is used to fetch a file, or collection of information from a specific remote repository and integrate it with another repository or a local branch. In other words, it is used to bring a local repository up-to-date with the remote. If you want to pull commits from the remote repository to the local repository you must use the Git pull command. Also you have the ability to specify the the source, or which commits to pull from Git.</p>
