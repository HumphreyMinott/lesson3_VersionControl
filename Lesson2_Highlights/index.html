            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A static webpage is defined as “a web page that is delivered to the user exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application”. These web pages may have a more basic, or even “boring”, look and feel to the site. It is made up of multiple HTML files. The page does not move or have any animations; therefore the code is easier and quicker to develop compared to dynamic webpages. Once a user loads the page, nothing changes. The website is as is, and stays that way as you scroll through it. I previously used the word “boring” to describe this topic because many people associate this type of page as being very plain. It is not as stylish as dynamic webpages and it lacks interactivity, so viewers aren’t really attracted to the site. It is usually used by smaller companies and never, or rarely needs to be updated. This topic is really interesting because a static webpage can still be useful. It is not obsolete and used by quite a few, so I am eager to learn more. I want to be fluent in web design whether it is a static or dynamic webpage.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Dynamic Web Page</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A dynamic webpage is define as “a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts”, meaning that when the web page is delivered to the users it is not static; It does not necessarily appear exactly as it is stored. The dynamic website is styled and animated with programs like JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheet. This interactive and stylishly designed webpage attracts visitors, as people find it is more interesting when compared to a static webpage. The dynamic webpage is just as it sounds, it is “dynamic”. The browser interface changes and it might not be the same for everyone at varying locations; each user experience is different. For example, if you two people access a dynamic webpage in different time zones, the time displayed on the webpage will not be the same for each. As far as developing a dynamic website, it is more extensive and complex than its counterpart because it requires more styling and other code. I am really interested in dynamic website. It makes me wonder what is next; we moved from the simple HTML to this. I believe we will soon develop a website that is so dynamic that it is different for each and every visitor </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Protocol stacks and packets is a way for computers to communicate with each. After connecting to the Internet and learning unique IP Address, as explained in the “Internet Addresses”, or highlighted number 4. Protocol stacks and packets is defined as “” Through the use of a protocol stack computers are able to communicate, or send messages to other computers. “Every computer needs one to communicate on the Internet and it is usually built into the computer's operating system the protocol stack used on the Internet is referred to as the TCP/IP protocol stack because of the two major communication protocols used”. In this lesson, protocol stacks and packets explains how stacks are formed, separated, and re-assembled into the original form (message) over the Internet. I think this concept is very interesting for this class. I had no idea before how computers truly communicated, let alone the steps it takes for them to communicate through the Internet to other computers. I find it fascinating how a simple message like hello goes through all of those numbers and steps. When I was ignorant about the subject, I just thought computers send a message as is without changing any forms.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Internet Addresses</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">An Internet address is a computer’s unique address when it is connected to the Internet. “Internet addresses are in the form nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn where nnn must be a number from 0 - 255. This address is known as an IP address”. An IP address, or Internet Protocol, is used to further specify a computer connected to the Internet. I comprehended this concept by breaking it down to simple terms. For example, a certain address is assigned to people who live in a certain home or location. This address, is used to identify the people and used to communicate with others, like sending mail to a certain address. IP Addresses are used to identify and communicate. There are two standards for IP addresses: IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6). Before further learning this concept in this class my definition of Internet Addresses was very limited. I just thought internet addresses was “www…”, world wide web address. Now I am really knowledge about this term. I understand that Internet Addresses are unique for each computer that is connected to the Internet. Can this unique address be traced back to a specific computer, is that what hackers do in the movies to find someone.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Ping Program</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Ping program is defined as “a computer network administration software utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network”. I related this concept to a submarine using sonar radar to detect the distance of object on the map. The Ping Program ultimately measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer that are echoed back to the source. So basically, it times how long a message from a computer, or an originating source takes to send to another destination computer. As stated in the lesson “The ping program will count the time expired until the reply comes back (if it does). Also, if you enter a domain name (i.e. www.yahoo.com) instead of an IP address, ping will resolve the domain name and display the computer's IP address.” I wonder what is the ultimate use for this program. What is the real importance in knowing how long a message takes to be received by another destination computer. This topic is really interesting and I would love to know more about it
